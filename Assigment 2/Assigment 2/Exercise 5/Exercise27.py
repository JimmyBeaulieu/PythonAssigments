# An automobile insurance company wants to computerize the calculation of renewals for the premiums of its clients.
# The increase of a clientâ€™s premium is a function of the number of accidents, according to the table below:
#
# Number of accidents	Increase
#       0   	            2%
#       1 or 2	            5%
#       3	                10%
#       4 and more	        30%
#
# 	You are asked to create a program that calculates the new value of a premium,
# 	according to the old premium and the number of accidents.
