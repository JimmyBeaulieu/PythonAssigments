# In a competition where scores are given by 6 judges,
# a competitorâ€™s final score is calculated as follows:
# first the highest and the lowest of the initial scores are eliminated,
# and then one takes the average of the other 4 scores.
# You are asked to create a program that reads 6 scores and determines the final score according to this method.
