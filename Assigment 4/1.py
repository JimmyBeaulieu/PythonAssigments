# This challenge is about using a collection (list) of integers and allowing the user
# to select options from a menu to perform operations on the list.
#
# Your program should display a menu options to the user as follows:
#
# P - Print numbers
# A - Add a number
# M - Display mean of the numbers
# S - Display the smallest number
# L - Display the largest number
# Q - Quit
#
# Enter your choice:
#
# The program should only accept valid choices from the user, both upper and lowercase selections should be allowed.
# If an illegal choice is made, you should display, "Unknown selection, please try again" and
# the menu options should be displayed again.
#
# If the user enters 'P' or 'p', you should display all the elements (ints) in the list.
# If the list is empty you should display "[] - the list is empty"
# If the list is not empty then all the list element should be displayed inside square brackets separated by a space.
# For example, [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
#
# If the user enters 'A' or 'a' then you should prompt the user for an integer to add to the list
# which you will add to the list and then display it was added. For example, if the user enters 5
# You should display, "5 added".
# Duplicate list entries are OK ! (for now. check a bit further for added functionalitiesâ€¦)
#
# If the user enters 'M' or 'm'  you should calculate the mean or average of the elements in the list and display it.
# If the list is empty you should display, "Unable to calculate the mean - no data"
#
# If the user enters 'S' or 's' you should display the smallest element in the list.
# For example, if the list contains [2 4 5 1],  you should display, "The smallest number is 1"
# If the list is empty you should display, "Unable to determine the smallest number - list is empty"
#
# If the user enters 'L' or 'l' you should display the largest element in the list
# For example, if the list contains [2 4 5 1], you should display, "The largest number is 5"
# If the list is empty you should display, "Unable to determine the largest number - list is empty"
#
# If the user enters 'Q' or 'q' then you should display 'Goodbye" and the program should terminate.
#
# Before you begin. Write out the steps you need to take and decide in what order they should be done. PSEUDOCODE
# Think about what loops you should use as well as what you will use for your selection logic.
#
# Finally, be sure to test your program as you go and at the end.
#
# Hint: Use a List!
#
# Additional functionality:
#
# - search for a number in the list and if found display the number of times it occurs in the list
# - clearing out the list (make it empty again) (Hint: the vector class has a .clear() method)
# - don't allow duplicate entries
# - come up with your own ideas! (add up one more functionality. Be creative !!)
